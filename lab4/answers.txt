unlinkat(AT_FDCWD, "file2.txt")



*Quesion*
Are the inodes the same for soft link file3 and file4

*Answer*
Creating file3.txt before the soft link gave
file3.txt 40075
file4.txt 40076

Creating the link without first creating file3.txt gave
40075 file4.txt -> file3.txt


Alterting file4.txt alters file3.txt


Removing file3.txt then altering file4.txt re-creates file3.txt as empty then fills it with the "alterings" that was done on file4.txt
